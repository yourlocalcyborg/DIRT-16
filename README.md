# DIRT-16
DIRT-16 (Dynamic Instruction and Register Toolkit - 16) is a 16-bit fantasy computer for recreational computing and retro-inspired game development. Features are described below.
It'll be a part of a fictional universe and made by a company called Generator Inc. whose logo is based off of a dahlia. I will write more details about the universe in the future. 

## Project Goals
- 16-bit CPU
- Runs on binaries (Will provide assembler and language with compiler)
- Capable of graphics and sound (3d if possible)
- Frontend that emulates screen and data cartridge interface
- More powerful than the SNES but less than the N64
- Circuit-switched networking a-la dial-up

## Todo list
- [ ] Implement Backend (CPU emulation library and related things)
- [ ] Write assembler for machine (DIRT16 Advanced High Level Instruction Assembler, or DAHLIA)
- [ ] Write compiler for machine (DIRTH, language based off of FORTH)
- [ ] Make test binaries for machine
- [ ] Implement Frontend (Computer with screen reading from framebuffer and drive port to place ports in)
- [ ] Create assets for frontend
- [ ] Clearer documentation of technical aspects

    - $(ADDR+rx)

### Hardware Blitter Spec
    - Does not share memory with CPU, internals locked off from user
    - CPU handles sprite tables
    - Registers (effectively just locations in mem)
        - BLT_SRC_HB, source addr in mem high byte (8-bit)
        - BLT_SRC_LW, source addr in mem low word (16-bit)
        - BLT_DST_HB, dest addr in mem (8-bit high byte of offset from framebuffer start)
        - BLT_DST_LW, dest addr in mem (16-bit low word of offset from framebuffer start)
        - BLT_W, width of rectangle (16-bit)
        - BLT_H, height of rectangle (16-bit)
        - BLT_COL, colour of rectangle if just filling, colour to make transparent if pasting (8-bit)
        - BLT_CTRL, control flags (8-bit)
            - bits 0-1 are blit mode, 0x0 to fill rect, 0x1 to copy rect, 0x2 to paste rect, 0x3 to paste rect w/ no transparency
            - bits 2-3 are rotation, 00 is no rotation, 01 is 90 degree rotation, 10 is 180 degrees, 11 is 270
            - bits 4-5 are flip 00 is no flip, 01 horizontal, 10 vertical, 11 horizontal and vertical)
            - bits 6-7 are unused
        - BLT_CMD, write to start operation (8-bit)
        - BLT_STATUS, read to check completion status (8-bit)
    - Clips automatically if not within framebuffer bounds

### Sound System Spec
- 6x Waveform channels
    - Select pulse, triangle, noise, sawtooth
- 2x PCM channels

### Networking Spec
- Current ideas are rough
- Switchboard server program that acts as middleman
- Circuit-switched
- Phone numbers assigned to users
- Bandwidth limit (~4 kbit/s)
- Latency (70ms added)
